  "ai_response": "Feeling lazy can be a challenge, but I've got just the thing to help you get moving and boost your mood.\n\nI recommend trying a short and sweet exercise called \"Morning Sun Salutations\" or \"Sunrise Stretch.\" It's a gentle, low-impact routine that combines yoga and stretching to help you wake up and feel more energized.\n\nHere's a simple 5-minute routine you can follow:\n\n1. Start by standing with your feet hip-width apart, arms by your sides.\n2. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, stretch your arms up towards the ceiling.\n3. Bend to one side, keeping your arms straight, and then the other side.\n4. Move into a gentle forward bend, stretching your back and legs.\n5. End with a few deep breaths, feeling the sun shine in through your windows (even if it's not actually sunny outside!).\n\nThis routine is great because it:\n\n* Gets your blood flowing and your heart rate up (just enough to feel energized, not exhausted)\n* Stretches your major muscle groups, including your back, shoulders, and legs\n* Helps release tension and calm your mind\n\nRemember, the goal is to feel good, not to push yourself too hard. Listen to your body and take breaks whenever you need to.\n\nWould you like me to suggest any modifications or variations based on your fitness level or any specific needs you may have?",
