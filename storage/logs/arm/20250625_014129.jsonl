Since the user prefers home-based exercises, I will recommend exercises that can be done without any equipment or with minimal equipment. I will also keep in mind the user's preference for showing images.\n\nTextual response:\nFor shoulder strength, I recommend the following exercises:\n\n1. **Dumbbell One Arm Lateral Raise**: This exercise targets the deltoids, which are the muscles responsible for shoulder movement. To perform this exercise, hold a dumbbell in one hand and lift your arm out to the side until it's at shoulder height. Lower your arm back down to the starting position and repeat with the other arm.\n\n2. **Dumbbell Standing Front Raise**: This exercise targets the front deltoids. To perform this exercise, hold a dumbbell in each hand and lift your arms straight out in front of you until they're at shoulder height. Lower your arms back down to the starting position and repeat.\n\n3. **Cable Lateral Raise**: This exercise targets the deltoids and can be done with a cable machine or a resistance band. To perform this exercise, hold the cable or resistance band in each hand and lift your arms out to the sides until they're at shoulder height. Lower your arms back down to the starting position and repeat.\n\nThese exercises are great for building shoulder strength and can be done from the comfort of your own home.\n\nImages:\n[355, 419, 178]",
