I will also prioritize exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once to make the most of the user's time.\n\nTextual response:\nBased on your preference for beginner-friendly exercises, I recommend the following triceps exercises:\n\n1. Bodyweight kneeling triceps extension: This exercise is a great way to target your triceps without any equipment. It's easy to learn and can be done in the comfort of your own home.\n2. Diamond push-up: This exercise works multiple muscle groups, including your triceps, chest, and shoulders. It's a great exercise for beginners who want to improve their overall upper body strength.\n3. Elbow dips: This exercise is another great option for beginners who want to target their triceps. It's easy to learn and can be done with minimal equipment.\n\nThese exercises are all beginner-friendly and can be modified to suit your fitness level. Remember to start with lighter weights and gradually increase the intensity as you get stronger.\n\nImages:\n[1771, 283, 3287]",
