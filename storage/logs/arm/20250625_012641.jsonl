require minimal equipment. I will also consider the user's preference for detailed explanations with step-by-step instructions.\n\nTextual response: Based on your preferences, I recommend the following beginner-friendly triceps exercises:\n\n1. **Dumbbell Kickback**: This exercise targets the triceps muscles and can be performed with dumbbells. To perform this exercise, hold a dumbbell in each hand and bend your knees slightly. Lean forward at the hips and lift the dumbbells behind you, keeping your upper arms still. Lower the dumbbells back to the starting position and repeat for 12-15 reps.\n2. **Cable Triceps Pushdown**: This exercise targets the triceps muscles and can be performed with a cable machine. To perform this exercise, hold a handle in each hand and extend your arms fully. Lower the handles down towards your thighs, keeping your upper arms still. Push the handles back up to the starting position and repeat for 12-15 reps.\n3. **Triceps Dip (Kneeling)**: This exercise targets the triceps muscles and can be performed with bodyweight. To perform this exercise, kneel on the floor with your hands gripping the edge of a bench or chair. Lower your body down by bending your elbows until your upper arms are parallel to the ground. Straighten your arms to return to the starting position and repeat for 12-15 reps.\n\nThese exercises are great for beginners because they are easy to perform and require minimal equipment. They also target the triceps muscles, which are essential for overall arm strength and development.\n\nImages: [60, 201, 129]",

  "ai_response": "Think: Based on the user's preference for home-based exercises, I will recommend exercises that can be performed at home with minimal equipment.\n\nTextual response: Yes, there are several triceps exercises that can be performed at home with minimal equipment. Here are a few options:\n\n1. **Bodyweight Triceps Dip**: This exercise targets the triceps muscles and can be performed at home with no equipment. To perform this exercise, place your hands on the edge of a chair or bench and lower your body down by bending your elbows until your upper arms are parallel to the ground. Straighten your arms to return to the starting position and repeat for 12-15 reps.\n2. **Dumbbell Kickback**: This exercise targets the triceps muscles and can be performed at home with dumbbells. To perform this exercise, hold a dumbbell in each hand and bend your knees slightly. Lean forward at the hips and lift the dumbbells behind you, keeping your upper arms still. Lower the dumbbells back to the starting position and repeat for 12-15 reps.\n3. **Close-Grip Push-Up**: This exercise targets the triceps muscles and can be performed at home with bodyweight. To perform this exercise, place your hands closer together than shoulder-width apart and lower your body down until your chest almost touches the ground. Push back up to the starting position and repeat for 12-15 reps.\n\nThese exercises are great for home-based workouts because they require minimal equipment and can be performed with bodyweight or dumbbells.\n\nImages: [129, 420, 283]",
