I will also make sure to provide detailed explanations with step-by-step instructions.\n\nTextual response:\nHere are some beginner-friendly triceps exercises that you can try:\n\n1. **Tricep Pushdowns**: This exercise targets the triceps muscles and can be done using a cable machine. To perform this exercise, hold a handle attached to the cable machine with your hands shoulder-width apart, and extend your arms straight down. Slowly lower the handle down towards your thighs, keeping your elbows close to your body, and then push it back up to the starting position.\n2. **Overhead Dumbbell Extension**: This exercise targets the triceps muscles and can be done using dumbbells. To perform this exercise, hold a dumbbell in each hand overhead with your arms extended, and then lower the dumbbells behind your head, keeping your elbows close to your body. Slowly lift the dumbbells back up to the starting position.\n3. **Tricep Kickbacks**: This exercise targets the triceps muscles and can be done using dumbbells. To perform this exercise, hold a dumbbell in one hand with your arm extended behind you, and then lift the dumbbell up and back, keeping your elbow close to your body. Slowly lower the dumbbell back down to the starting position and repeat with the other arm.\n\nThese exercises are great for beginners because they are easy to learn and require minimal equipment. Make sure to start with light weights and gradually increase the weight as you become stronger.\n\nImages:\n[]",

  "raw_extraction": "Reasoning:\nTo identify new preferences about how explanations should be delivered, I carefully read the 'last_user_message' in the context of the full 'chat_history'. \n\nFirst, I looked for any explicit statements about preferences. In this case, the 'last_user_message' is \"Can you show images?\" which suggests that the user wants to see images as part of the explanation.\n\nHowever, I also considered the possibility that the user might have expressed multiple qualities about explanations, such as [\"pref1 and pref2\"]. In this case, the user's previous message was about beginner-friendly exercises, and the assistant provided a detailed explanation with step-by-step instructions. But the user didn't express any additional preferences about the format of the explanation.\n\nTherefore, I concluded that the only new preference is about showing images.\n\nOutput: {\"new_preferences\": [\"show images\"]}",

  "raw_merge": "Reasoning:\n1. Start by comparing the two lists for any duplicates. Since there are no identical strings, we can proceed with the rest of the rules.\n\n2. Compare the lists for any contradictory preferences. \"free of technical jargon\" and \"Add formatting\" seem to be opposite, as \"Add formatting\" implies some level of technical jargon. We keep the new preference \"Add formatting\" and remove the old one \"free of technical jargon\".\n\n3. Check for more specific or refined preferences. \"detailed explanations with step-by-step instructions\" is a more specific version of \"beginner-friendly\". We keep the more specific one \"detailed explanations with step-by-step instructions\" and remove the old one \"beginner-friendly\".\n\n4. Check for any other conflicts or compatible preferences. There are no other conflicts or compatible preferences that need to be addressed.\n\n5. The final merged list consists of all the preferences that were not removed, along with the new preference that was added.\n\nOutput: {\"merged_preferences\": [\"beginner-friendly\", \"detailed explanations with step-by-step instructions\", \"Add formatting\", \"show images\"]}",
