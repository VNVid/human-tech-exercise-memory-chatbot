I will also prioritize exercises that target the triceps muscles without putting excessive strain on the joints.\n\nTextual response:\nFor a beginner-friendly triceps workout, I recommend starting with the diamond push-up and the bodyweight kneeling triceps extension. These exercises are easy to learn and can be done with minimal equipment. The diamond push-up targets the triceps muscles while also engaging the chest and shoulders, making it a great exercise for overall upper body development. The bodyweight kneeling triceps extension is a great exercise for isolating the triceps muscles and can be modified to suit different fitness levels.\n\nImages:\n[283, 1771]",
