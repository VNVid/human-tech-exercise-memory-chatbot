I will also prioritize exercises that target the biceps muscle effectively.\n\nTextual response:\nFor a great biceps workout using dumbbells, I recommend trying the dumbbell alternate biceps curl and the dumbbell hammer curl. These exercises are perfect for beginners as they are easy to learn and require minimal equipment. To perform the dumbbell alternate biceps curl, hold a dumbbell in each hand and bend your elbows to curl the dumbbells towards your shoulders, alternating arms with each rep. For the dumbbell hammer curl, hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing towards your body and curl the dumbbells towards your shoulders, keeping your upper arms still.\n\nImages:\n[285, 313]",
