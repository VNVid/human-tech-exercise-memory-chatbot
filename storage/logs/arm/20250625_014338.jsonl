The user also prefers action-oriented and practical explanations, so I will focus on providing clear and concise instructions for each exercise.\n\nTextual response:\nFor shoulder strength, I recommend the following exercises that can be done with minimal equipment:\n\n1. Dumbbell alternate side press: This exercise targets the delt muscles and can be done with a pair of dumbbells. To perform this exercise, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand. Press the dumbbell in one hand upwards, keeping your elbow at a 90-degree angle, and then lower it back down to the starting position. Alternate arms with each repetition.\n2. Dumbbell one arm lateral raise: This exercise targets the delt muscles and can be done with a dumbbell. To perform this exercise, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell in one hand. Lift the dumbbell out to the side, keeping your arm straight, and then lower it back down to the starting position. Alternate arms with each repetition.\n\nImages:\n[286, 355]",

I noticed that the 'last_user_message' is \"Find exercises that can be done at home without equipment\". This message is a request for specific exercises that meet certain criteria, which suggests that the user is looking for practical and actionable information.\n\n2. I then looked at the 'chat_history' to see if there were any previous messages that indicated the user's preferences for explanations. In the first message, the user asked for exercises for shoulder strength, which suggests that the user is interested in exercises that target specific muscle groups.\n\n3. However, there were no other messages in the 'chat_history' that indicated specific preferences for how explanations should be delivered. Therefore, I looked for any keywords or phrases in the 'last_user_message' that could indicate new preferences.\n\n4. Upon closer inspection, I noticed that the 'last_user_message' contains the phrase \"without equipment\", which suggests that the user prefers explanations that are relevant to their specific needs and circumstances.\n\n5. I also noticed that the 'last_user_message' contains the phrase \"at home\", which suggests that the user prefers explanations that are practical and applicable to their daily life.\n\n6.

Chair leg extended stretch: This exercise targets the quadriceps muscles. To perform this exercise, stand behind a sturdy chair and place one hand on the seat. Lift one leg out to the side, keeping your knee straight, and then lower it back down to the starting position. Alternate legs with each repetition.\n2. Hanging straight leg hip raise: This exercise targets the abdominal muscles. To perform this exercise, find a sturdy bar or ledge that you can hang from with your hands shoulder-width apart.
