I will also consider exercises that are beginner-friendly and target the triceps muscle.\n\nTextual response:\nFor a beginner-friendly triceps workout, I recommend starting with the diamond push-up and bodyweight kneeling triceps extension. These exercises are easy to learn and require no equipment, making them perfect for beginners. The diamond push-up targets the triceps muscle while also engaging the chest and shoulders, while the bodyweight kneeling triceps extension isolates the triceps muscle, making it an effective exercise for building strength.\n\nImages:\n[283, 1771]",
