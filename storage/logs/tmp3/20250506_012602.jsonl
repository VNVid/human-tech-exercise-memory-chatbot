However, they also mention they don't want too much info this time, which suggests they want to limit the amount of content they see.\n4. They specifically ask for the \"2 best ones for posture,\" which implies they want to see a curated selection of exercises.\n5. From this, I can infer that the user wants concise explanations that focus on the most relevant information.\n\nOutput: {\"new_preferences\": [\"more concise\", \"curated selection\", \"limited amount of content\"]}",

  "ai_response": "Based on your preferences, I'll give you 2 concise exercises to improve your posture:\n\n1. **Chest Stretch**: Stand in a doorway with your hands on the doorframe at shoulder height. Lean forward until you feel a stretch in your chest. Hold for 30 seconds.\n2. **Bridge**: Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat.
