Helps to loosen tight muscles in the back and neck\n2.  Improves flexibility and range of motion\n3.  Can help reduce muscle spasms and tension\n\nHere's how to do it:\n\n1.  Start on your hands and knees (all fours).\n2.  Inhale and arch your back, lifting your tailbone and head towards the ceiling (like a cat).\n3.  Exhale and round your back, tucking your chin to your chest and your tailbone towards the floor (like a cow).\n4.  Repeat this motion 5-10 times, moving slowly and smoothly.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n*   Start slow and gentle, especially if you're new to this exercise or have severe back pain.\n*   Listen to your body and stop if you experience any sharp pain or discomfort.\n*   You can do this exercise 2-3 times a day, or as often as your body allows.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to know more about this exercise or other options.",
