Here are a few exercises you can try:\n\nFor your biceps, try dumbbell hammer curls, dumbbell standing biceps curls, or dumbbell bicep curls on an exercise ball with leg raised. These exercises will help you build strength and size in your upper arms.\n\nFor your triceps, try dumbbell standing bent over one arm triceps extension or cable triceps pushdown (v-bar) (with arm blaster). These exercises will help you build strength and size in the back of your upper arms.\n\nFor your shoulders, try cable rear delt row (stirrups), cable seated shoulder internal rotation, or dumbbell standing palms in press. These exercises will help you build strength and size in your shoulders.\n\nRemember to start with lighter weights and gradually increase the weight as you get stronger. It's also important to focus on proper form and technique to avoid injury.\n\nImages: \n[2405, 313, 427]",

The last user message is \"I prefer more structured responses, mb try using some formatting.

This suggests that the user is not entirely sure about their preferences, but I will still consider it as a separate preference.\n\n3. \"using some formatting\"\n\nOutput: \n{\"new_preferences\": [\"structured responses\", \"using some formatting\", \"describing each exercise in more detail\"]}",

  "raw_merge": "Reasoning:\n1. Compare 'new_preferences' with 'old_preferences' to identify any contradictions, refinements, or compatible preferences.\n2. Identify any new preferences that contradict old ones. In this case, 'structured responses' contradicts 'be concise' because they express opposite values (structured responses implies more detailed and possibly less concise responses).\n3. Identify any new preferences that are more specific or refined versions of old ones. In this case, 'describing each exercise in more detail' is a more specific version of 'be relevant' because it provides more context and detail about the relevance of each exercise.\n4. Identify any new preferences that are compatible with old ones. In this case, 'using some formatting' is compatible with both 'be concise' and 'be relevant' because it does not express opposite values and can be achieved without compromising conciseness or relevance.\n5. Remove any old preferences that contradict new ones. In this case, remove 'be concise' because it contradicts 'structured responses'.\n6. Remove any old preferences that are less specific or refined versions of new ones. In this case, remove 'be relevant' because it is less specific than 'describing each exercise in more detail'.\n7. Add any new preferences that do not contradict or replace old ones.
