Here are a few exercises that you can try:\n\n* **Dumbbell Bicep Curl**: This exercise targets the biceps and can be done with dumbbells or a barbell. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold the dumbbells with your palms facing forward. Curl the dumbbells up towards your shoulders, then lower them back down to the starting position.\n* **Dumbbell Triceps Extension**: This exercise targets the triceps and can be done with dumbbells or a barbell. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold the dumbbells with your arms extended overhead. Lower the dumbbells behind your head, then raise them back up to the starting position.\n* **Cable Lateral Raise**: This exercise targets the delt muscles and can be done with a cable machine. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold the cable handle with your arms at your sides. Raise the handle out to the sides until it's at shoulder height, then lower it back down to the starting position.\n\nRemember to start with lighter weights and gradually increase the weight as you become stronger.\n\nImages:\n[1652, 1740, 416, 427]\n\nNote: I've chosen to include images for these exercises because you've specified that you prefer structured responses with visuals.",
