This exercise is a gentle and effective way to stretch your spine, relieve tension, and improve flexibility. To perform the Cat-Cow Stretch, start on your hands and knees. As you inhale, arch your back, lifting your tailbone and head towards the ceiling (like a cat). As you exhale, round your back, tucking your chin to your chest and your tailbone towards the floor (like a cow). Repeat this motion several times, moving slowly and smoothly.\n\nThis exercise targets the entire spine, from the neck to the lower back, and can help alleviate back pain by releasing tension and improving flexibility. It's also a low-impact exercise, making it suitable for people with back pain or other mobility issues.\n\nImages: [3158]",
