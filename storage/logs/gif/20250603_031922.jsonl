These muscles play a crucial role in burning belly fat and toning your waistline.\n\nHere are some exercises that you can try:\n\n*   **Russian twists**: This exercise targets your obliques and can help burn belly fat. To perform a Russian twist, sit on the floor with your knees bent and feet flat. Lean back slightly and twist your torso from side to side, touching your hands to the ground each time.\n*   **Leg raises**: This exercise targets your rectus abdominis and can help tone your waistline. To perform a leg raise, lie on your back with your arms extended overhead and raise your legs straight up towards the ceiling. Lower your legs back down to the starting position and repeat.\n*   **Plank**: This exercise targets your entire core, including your obliques and rectus abdominis. To perform a plank, start in a push-up position with your hands shoulder-width apart. Engage your core muscles and hold the position for 30-60 seconds.\n\nRemember to always listen to your body and start slowly, especially if you're new to exercise. It's also essential to incorporate a balanced diet and regular cardio exercise to achieve your weight loss goals.\n\nImages: []",

Lean back slightly and twist your torso from side to side, touching your hands to the ground each time. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1.  Sit on the floor with your knees bent and feet flat.\n2.  Lean back slightly, keeping your back straight.\n3.  Twist your torso from side to side, touching your hands to the ground each time.\n4.  Continue twisting for 10-15 repetitions on each side.\n5.  Rest for 30 seconds and repeat for 2-3 sets.\n\nTips:\n\n*   Keep your core muscles engaged throughout the exercise to maintain stability and prevent injury.\n*   Use a slow and controlled motion to twist your torso.\n*   Avoid using momentum or jerking movements, as this can put unnecessary strain on your back and abdominal muscles.\n\nImages:\n[3]",
