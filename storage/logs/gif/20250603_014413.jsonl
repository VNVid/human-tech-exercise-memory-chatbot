However, there were no such statements. \n\nNext, I examined the 'last_user_message' for any implicit preferences that might be related to how explanations should be delivered. The 'last_user_message' is \"Recommend me an exercise for back pain relief\". This message does not provide any information about how explanations should be delivered.\n\nSince the 'last_user_message' does not provide any information about how explanations should be delivered, I looked at the 'chat_history' to see if there were any previous messages that might be relevant. However, the 'chat_history' does not contain any messages that provide information about how explanations should be delivered.\n\nGiven that the 'last_user_message' and the 'chat_history' do not provide any information about how explanations should be delivered, I conclude that there are no new preferences about how explanations should be delivered.\n\nOutput: {\"new_preferences\": []}",

  "ai_response": "Based on your request, I recommend trying the \"bodyweight standing close-grip row\" (ID: 3158). This exercise targets the upper back muscles, which are often involved in back pain relief.\n\nTo perform this exercise:\n\n1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a towel or resistance band in both hands.\n2. Bend your knees slightly and lean forward at the hips, keeping your back straight.\n3. Let your arms hang straight down from your shoulders, with your hands gripping the towel or band.\n4. Slowly pull the towel or band towards your chest, keeping your elbows close to your body.\n5. Hold for a brief moment, then release and repeat for 10-15 repetitions.\n\nThis exercise can help strengthen your upper back muscles, which can help alleviate back pain. However, please consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise routine, especially if you have a pre-existing back condition.\n\nTextual response:\nGive it a try and see how it feels!\n\nImages: [3158]",
