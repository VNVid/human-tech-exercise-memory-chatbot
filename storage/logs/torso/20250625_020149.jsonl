Given the goal of strengthening the spine for posture, I will suggest an exercise that targets the muscles responsible for maintaining good posture.\n\nTextual response:\nBased on your preference for a \"super short\" explanation, I recommend trying the \"back extension on exercise ball\" exercise. This exercise targets the muscles in your back, which are essential for maintaining good posture. To perform this exercise, lie on an exercise ball with your stomach facing down, and then lift your arms and legs off the ground, keeping your back straight. Hold for a few seconds, and then slowly lower back down. Repeat this process for 10-15 repetitions.\n\nImages:\n[1314]",
