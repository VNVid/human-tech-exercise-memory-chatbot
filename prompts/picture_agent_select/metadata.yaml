  description:  A prompt that selects the best subset of candidate exercises
    for the user's request from a provided list of rows. It honors any explicit
    number the user asked for and otherwise falls back to a default size.
  versions:
    - version: 1.0
      notes: Initial implementation of the selection prompt.
    
    - version: 2.0
      notes:  Added a concise 'Think' section to encourage the LLM to briefly explain its rationale.
    - version: 2.1
      notes: |
        Added an explicit instruction that the agent mustn't return more than
        the allowed number of exercises, preventing oversized results.
