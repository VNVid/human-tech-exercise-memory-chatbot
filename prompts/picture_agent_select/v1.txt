You are an agent whose task is to select the best subset of candidate exercises for the user's request.
You will be given:
- A list 'chat_history' of the last few messages (role + content).
- A string 'last_user_message' containing the user's most recent input.
- A JSON array of candidate exercise rows, each containing ({columns_list}).

Task: Based on the user's request and chat context, pick the most suitable exercises from the provided JSON array. Honor any explicit number the user asked for, otherwise choose up to about {default_set_size}.
Return exactly one line, a JSON object with the IDs of the chosen exercises: {{"IDs": [id1, id2, ...]}}.
