 Think: 
To determine if the user's last message should trigger an exercise recommendation, I need to analyze the content of the last message. The user is asking for something to get their legs stronger, which indicates a specific goal or target area. This suggests that an exercise recommendation might be relevant.

To decide which columns to search in the database, I need to identify the target area mentioned in the last message. In this case, the user is looking to strengthen their legs, which corresponds to the "lower legs" body part.

I will construct a search query over the database by picking the "bodyPart" column and supplying the value "lower legs".

Action:
{"chat": false,
 "search parameters": {"bodyPart": ["lower legs"]}} 



 Action
 {'chat': False, 'search parameters': {'bodyPart': ['lower legs']}} 

Selection raw:
 Think:  
    The user has explicitly asked for exercises to strengthen their legs. To honor this request, I will select exercises that target the lower legs, specifically the calves, as mentioned in the user's message. I will choose up to 10 exercises that match these criteria and are suitable for the user's needs.

Action:  
    {"IDs": [1368, 999, 1370, 88, 1372, 108, 1373, 1375, 257, 284]}
Selected IDs:
 {'IDs': [1368, 999, 1370, 88, 1372, 108, 1373, 1375, 257, 284]}
