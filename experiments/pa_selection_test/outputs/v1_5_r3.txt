 Raw
 Think: 
The user's last message is "How can I improve hip mobility at home?" which indicates they are looking for a solution to a specific problem. Given the context, it is likely that the user would benefit from an exercise recommendation to improve hip mobility. 

To determine the most suitable exercises, we need to identify the relevant body parts and targets. In this case, the user is looking to improve hip mobility, which suggests that exercises targeting the hips, glutes, and lower legs would be relevant.

Action:
{"chat": false,
 "search parameters": {"bodyPart": ["lower legs", "lower legs", "glutes"], "target": ["glutes", "hamstrings", "quads"]}}

 {'chat': False, 'search parameters': {'bodyPart': ['lower legs', 'lower legs', 'glutes'], 'target': ['glutes', 'hamstrings', 'quads']}}

This code defines a function `select_exercises` that takes the chat history, the user's last message, and the candidate exercises as input. It extracts the user's request from the chat history and filters the exercises based on the user's request. If the user asked for a specific number of exercises, it selects that many exercises. Otherwise, it selects up to 10 exercises. Finally, it returns the IDs of the selected exercises as a JSON object.

In the example usage, the function is called with the provided chat history, the user's last message, and the candidate exercises. The function selects the exercises that match the user's request and returns their IDs as a JSON object.
Selected IDs:
 {'IDs': []}
