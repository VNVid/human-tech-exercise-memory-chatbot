To determine if the user's last message should trigger an exercise recommendation, I need to analyze the content of the message. 
The user's last message is "I want to lose weight and get a smaller waist." 
This message indicates that the user is interested in weight loss and specifically mentions a smaller waist, which is a body part. 
Based on this information, it seems that the user is looking for exercises that can help with weight loss and targeting the waist area.
