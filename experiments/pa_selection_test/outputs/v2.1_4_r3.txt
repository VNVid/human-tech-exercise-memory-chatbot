 Raw
 Think: 
To determine if the user's last message should trigger an exercise recommendation, I need to analyze the content of the last message. 
The user's last message is "Recommend me something to get my legs stronger". 
This message is a clear request for a recommendation, and the user specifically mentions "legs", which is a body part. 
Therefore, I should trigger an exercise recommendation.

Action:
{"chat": false,
 "search parameters": {"bodyPart": ["lower legs"]}} 



 Action
 {'chat': False, 'search parameters': {'bodyPart': ['lower legs']}} 

Selection raw:
 Think:  
The user has explicitly asked for exercises to get their legs stronger, so I will prioritize exercises that target the lower legs and specifically the calves. I will also consider the equipment mentioned in the user's message, which is none, so I will choose exercises that can be done with body weight or any other equipment.

Action:  
{"IDs": [1368, 999, 1370, 88, 1372, 409, 417, 1383, 1384, 257]}
Selected IDs:
 {'IDs': [1368, 999, 1370, 88, 1372, 409, 417, 1383, 1384, 257]}
