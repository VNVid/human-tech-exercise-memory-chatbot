  "raw_extraction": "Reasoning:\nThe task is to extract new user preferences from the last message in the context of the full chat history. \nSince the chat history is empty, we will focus on the last user message: \"Recommend exercises that are medically proven to help manage stress and anxiety, and provide references to supporting studies.\"\nWe need to identify any new preferences about how explanations should be delivered, such as the format, content, or tone.\n\nLooking at the last user message, we can see that the user is asking for medically proven exercises and references to supporting studies. This implies that the user wants evidence-based information and references to credible sources.\n\nTo identify new preferences, we can look for keywords or phrases that indicate a specific format or content preference. In this case, the user is asking for \"medically proven\" exercises, which suggests a preference for explanations that are based on scientific evidence.\n\nWe can also look for phrases that indicate a specific tone or style, such as \"provide references to supporting studies.\" This suggests a preference for explanations that are formal, objective, and provide credible sources to support the information.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can identify two new preferences:\n\n1. Explanations should be based on scientific evidence (medically proven).\n2. Explanations should provide credible sources to support the information (references to supporting studies).\n\nOutput: \n{\n  \"new_preferences\": [\"medically proven\", \"references to supporting studies\"]\n}",

I will also provide references to supporting studies.\n\nTextual response:\nExercises that have been shown to help manage stress and anxiety include yoga, tai chi, and aerobic exercise. Yoga, in particular, has been found to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression in individuals with chronic pain (Morone et al., 2008). Tai chi has also been shown to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression in older adults (Wang et al., 2010). Aerobic exercise has been found to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression in individuals with chronic anxiety (Harris et al., 2006).\n\nI recommend trying \"Alternate Lateral Pulldown\" (id: 7) and \"Assisted Hanging Knee Raise with Throw Down\" (id: 10). These exercises can help reduce stress and anxiety by releasing endorphins, which are natural mood-boosters.\n\nImages:\n[7, 10]\n\nReferences:\nHarris, S.
