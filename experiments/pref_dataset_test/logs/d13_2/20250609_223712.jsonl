I will choose exercises that are easy to understand and perform, as per the user's preferences.\n\nTextual response: To make your core stronger, I recommend trying the 3/4 sit-up, air bike, or alternate heel touchers. These exercises are great for engaging your abs and lower back muscles. The 3/4 sit-up is a classic exercise that targets the rectus abdominis muscle. The air bike is a great exercise for working your entire core, including your obliques and lower back muscles. Alternate heel touchers are a fun and challenging exercise that targets the obliques.\n\nImages: [1, 3, 6]\nIf you want to see how these exercises are performed, I can show you animations of the 3/4 sit-up, air bike, and alternate heel touchers.",

I will read the 'last_user_message' and analyze it in the context of the full 'chat_history'.\n\nThe 'last_user_message' is \"Can you just give me a normal list of exercises? That feels a bit too childish now. No extra explanations needed.\"\n\nFrom this message, I can infer that the user wants a list of exercises without any extra explanations or childish content. The user explicitly states that they want \"a normal list of exercises\" and that \"No extra explanations needed.\"\n\nI can break down the user's preferences into individual aspects:\n\n1. The user wants a \"normal list of exercises.\" This implies that the user wants a straightforward and simple list of exercises without any extra features or explanations.\n2. The user wants \"No extra explanations needed.\" This implies that the user does not want any additional explanations or descriptions of the exercises.\n\nBased on these aspects, I can identify the user's preferences as:\n\n- \"a normal list of exercises\"\n- \"No extra explanations needed\"\n\nThese preferences can be expressed as separate strings, corresponding to a single aspect.\n\nOutput: {\"new_preferences\": [\"a normal list of exercises\", \"No extra explanations needed\"]}",

Identify 'a normal list of exercises' as a more specific preference compared to 'simple explanations' (rule 3).\n3. Identify 'No extra explanations needed' as a preference that contradicts 'explain it like I'm a child' (rule 2).\n4. Since 'No extra explanations needed' is more specific than 'simple explanations', remove 'simple explanations' (rule 3).\n5. 'explain it like I'm a child' and 'No extra explanations needed' are contradictory, so keep 'No extra explanations needed' and remove 'explain it like I'm a child' (rule 2).\n6.
