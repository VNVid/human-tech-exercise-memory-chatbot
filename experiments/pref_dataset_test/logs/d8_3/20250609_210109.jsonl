Since you tend to give up on workouts, I'll suggest something short and manageable.\n\nTextual response:\nI've got just the thing for you! Have you ever tried ankle circles? It's a simple exercise that can be done anywhere, without any equipment. All you need to do is sit comfortably with your legs straight out in front of you, lift one foot off the ground, and draw circles with your ankle. Start with small circles and gradually increase the size as you get more comfortable. This exercise is great for warming up your lower legs and can be done for just a few minutes a day.\n\nImages:\n[1368]\nThis exercise is easy to do and requires no equipment, making it perfect for beginners.",
