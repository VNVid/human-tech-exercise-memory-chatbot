Deep breathing exercises, such as diaphragmatic breathing, can calm the mind and body. Another effective exercise is progressive muscle relaxation, which involves tensing and relaxing different muscle groups to release physical tension. Additionally, yoga and tai chi can help reduce stress and anxiety by promoting relaxation and improving mood.\n\nImages:\n[]",

When you feel overwhelmed, try taking a few minutes to practice deep breathing. For example, you can do this exercise during your daily commute, while waiting in line, or before bed. Sit comfortably with your back straight, close your eyes, and focus on taking slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. Try to breathe in for a count of 4, hold for a count of 4, and breathe out for a count of 4. As you breathe out, imagine any tension or stress leaving your body. Repeat this process several times, and see how it helps you feel more calm and centered.\n\nImages:\n[466]",
