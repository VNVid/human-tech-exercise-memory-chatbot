I look at the full chat history to see if there are any previous messages that might indicate a preference for how explanations should be delivered.\n3. Since there are no previous messages, I focus on the last user message to identify any preferences.\n4. The user mentions \"I don’t want too much info this time,\" which implies a preference for concise explanations.\n5. The user also mentions \"Just give me 2 best ones for posture,\" which implies a preference for prioritizing the most relevant or important information.\n6. I consider the user's request for \"2 best ones\" as a separate preference for brevity and relevance.\n7. I conclude that the user has expressed two separate preferences: one for concise explanations and another for prioritizing the most relevant information.\n\nOutput: \n{\n  \"new_preferences\": [\"concise explanations\", \"prioritize relevance\"]\n}",

'more detail' and 'concise explanations' are contradictory, so we keep 'concise explanations' and remove 'more detail'.\n3. 'see a study' and 'prioritize relevance' relate to different concepts, so we keep both.\n4. 'see a study' and 'prioritize relevance' are compatible, so we keep both.\n5.

Cable Lat Pulldown Full Range of Motion: This exercise targets the latissimus dorsi muscles, which help maintain good posture by pulling the shoulders back and down. To perform this exercise, attach a cable to a stable anchor point and hold a handle with both hands. Keeping your arms straight, pull the handle towards your chest, squeezing your lats at the top of the movement.\n2. Hyperextension: This exercise targets the erector spinae muscles, which help maintain good posture by extending the spine. To perform this exercise, lie on your stomach with your arms extended overhead. Slowly lift your arms, shoulders, and upper back off the ground, keeping your lower back pressed into the floor.\n\nImages: [2330, 489]",
