When you're feeling overwhelmed, try this exercise to help you focus on the present moment. For example, you can do it during a busy morning routine, right before bed, or during a short break at work.\n\nHere's how it works: when you're feeling anxious or stressed, your body's \"fight or flight\" response is triggered, causing your heart rate to increase and your breathing to become shallow. The Deep Breathing Exercise helps counteract this response by slowing down your heart rate and promoting relaxation. By focusing on your breath, you can calm your mind and body, making it easier to manage stress and anxiety.\n\nTo get the most out of this exercise, try to practice it regularly, ideally at the same time each day. This will help you develop a sense of calm and reduce feelings of anxiety.\n\nImages:\n[]",
