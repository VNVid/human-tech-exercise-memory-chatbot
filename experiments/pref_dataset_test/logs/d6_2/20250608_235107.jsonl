To do this exercise, sit or stand with your feet flat on the ground, and lift one foot off the ground. Make small circles with your ankle, first clockwise and then counterclockwise. Repeat this process with the other foot. You can do this exercise while watching TV, during a break at work, or even while waiting in line.\n\nFor example, if you're feeling overwhelmed by a long to-do list, try doing some ankle circles while you're waiting for a meeting to start. This can help calm your mind and reduce feelings of anxiety. Alternatively, if you're feeling stressed after a long day, try doing some ankle circles while you're watching TV or reading a book. This can help release physical tension and promote relaxation.\n\nImages:\n[2]",
