Given the user's preference for concise and actionable advice, I'll focus on exercises that can be done at home with minimal equipment.\n\nTextual response: For relieving back pain, I recommend trying the \"back lever\" and \"bodyweight standing close-grip row\" exercises. These exercises target the upper back muscles, which are essential for maintaining good posture and reducing strain on the spine. The \"back lever\" exercise specifically targets the latissimus dorsi muscles, while the \"bodyweight standing close-grip row\" targets the trapezius and rhomboid muscles. Both exercises can be done at home with no equipment required.\n\nImages: [3297, 3158]",
