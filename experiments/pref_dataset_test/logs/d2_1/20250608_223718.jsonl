Given the user's preference for clear and concise explanations, I'll focus on providing straightforward instructions and highlighting the benefits of each exercise.\n\nTextual response:\nFor relieving back pain, I recommend trying the back lever, bodyweight standing row, or the elevator exercise. These exercises target the muscles in the upper back, which can help alleviate tension and improve posture. The back lever is a great exercise for strengthening the latissimus dorsi muscles, while the bodyweight standing row targets the trapezius and rhomboid muscles. The elevator exercise, on the other hand, engages the entire upper back, including the trapezius, rhomboids, and latissimus dorsi muscles.\n\nImages:\n[3297, 3166, 3292]\n\nNote: I've chosen to include images for the back lever, bodyweight standing row, and elevator exercises, as they are all relevant to the user's request and align with their preferences for clear and concise explanations.",
