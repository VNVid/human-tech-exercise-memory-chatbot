This exercise targets the upper back muscles, which are often strained from prolonged sitting. To perform the exercise, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a towel or resistance band with both hands. Keeping your arms straight, lift the towel or band out to the sides until your shoulders are fully extended. Slowly return to the starting position and repeat for 10-15 repetitions. This exercise can be done with or without a towel, depending on your comfort level.\n\nImages: [3166]",
