Just give me 2 best ones for posture.\"\nFrom this message, I can identify two preferences expressed by the user:\n1. The user wants to try more exercises.\n2. The user does not want too much information this time.\n3. The user wants to receive only the 2 best ones for posture.\nHowever, the task requires me to treat each preference as a separate string, corresponding to a single aspect. Therefore, I will treat \"I want to try more exercises\" as a separate preference, and \"I don’t want too much info this time\" as another separate preference.\n\nOutput: {\"new_preferences\": [\"I want to try more exercises\", \"I don’t want too much info this time\", \"Just give me 2 best ones for posture\"]}",

  "raw_merge": "Reasoning:\n1. Start by comparing the two lists for any duplicates. Since none of the preferences are identical, we can proceed to the next steps.\n2. Compare the new preferences with the old ones to identify any contradictions. \"I don’t want too much info this time\" contradicts \"in a small paragraph\" because they express opposite values (less info vs. a small paragraph).\n3. Identify any preferences that relate to the same concept but one is a more specific or refined version. \"Just give me 2 best ones for posture\" is a more specific version of \"I want to try more exercises\" because it specifies the type of exercises (posture) and the number (2 best ones).\n4. Drop preferences ONLY in cases of contradictions or more specific versions. Since \"I don’t want too much info this time\" contradicts \"in a small paragraph\", we remove \"in a small paragraph\" from the old preferences.\n5. Since \"Just give me 2 best ones for posture\" is a more specific version of \"I want to try more exercises\", we remove \"I want to try more exercises\" from the old preferences.\n6. The new preference \"I want to try more exercises\" is compatible with \"Just give me 2 best ones for posture\", so we keep both.\n7. The new preference \"I don’t want too much info this time\" is compatible with \"in a small paragraph\", so we keep both.\n\nOutput: {\"merged_preferences\": [\"evidence-based explanations\", \"I don’t want too much info this time\", \"Just give me 2 best ones for posture\"]}",

I will also keep in mind that you don't want too much information this time, so I will provide a concise explanation of each exercise.\n\nTextual response:\nBased on your preference for posture exercises, I recommend the following two exercises:\n\n1. **Cable Rope Seated Row**: This exercise targets the upper back muscles, which are essential for maintaining good posture. It helps strengthen the muscles that pull your shoulders back and keep your spine straight.\n2. **Barbell Pendlay Row**: This exercise also targets the upper back muscles, helping to strengthen the muscles that maintain good posture. It's a great exercise for improving posture and reducing back pain.\n\nImages:\n[1323, 3017]",
