To understand why it works, let's break it down.\n\nTextual response:\nThe chin tuck exercise works by engaging the muscles in the back of your neck, specifically the suboccipital muscles. When you tuck your chin in, you're creating a gentle stretch in these muscles, which helps to strengthen them. This can lead to improved posture, as you're more aware of the position of your head and neck. Regular practice can also help alleviate tension headaches and improve overall neck mobility.\n\nImages: []",

These muscles are responsible for maintaining the posture of the head and neck. When you tuck your chin in, you're creating a gentle stretch in these muscles, which helps to strengthen them. This can lead to improved posture, as you're more aware of the position of your head and neck.\n\nTextual response:\nThe chin tuck exercise works by engaging the suboccipital muscles, specifically the rectus capitis posterior major, obliquus capitis inferior, and obliquus capitis superior. When you tuck your chin in, you're creating a gentle stretch in these muscles, which helps to strengthen them (1). This can lead to improved posture, as you're more aware of the position of your head and neck. Regular practice can also help alleviate tension headaches and improve overall neck mobility (2). A study published in the Journal of Manual & Manipulative Therapy found that the suboccipital muscles are responsible for maintaining the posture of the head and neck, and that exercises that target these muscles can lead to improved posture and reduced muscle tension (3).\n\nReferences:\n1.
