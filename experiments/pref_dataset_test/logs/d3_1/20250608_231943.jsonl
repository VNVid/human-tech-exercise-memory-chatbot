The last user message is \"Recommend exercises that are medically proven to help manage stress and anxiety, and provide references to supporting studies.\"\n\nTo identify new preferences, I will look for words or phrases that indicate how explanations should be delivered. I will consider each word or phrase as a separate preference.\n\nUpon examining the last user message, I notice the following words or phrases that could indicate new preferences:\n\n- \"medically proven\" suggests that the user wants explanations that are based on scientific evidence.\n- \"references to supporting studies\" suggests that the user wants explanations that include citations or references to external sources.\n\nThese words or phrases are not explicitly stated as separate preferences, but they can be inferred as separate aspects of how explanations should be delivered.\n\nTherefore, I will treat \"medically proven\" and \"references to supporting studies\" as separate preferences.\n\nOutput: {\"new_preferences\": [\"medically proven\", \"references to supporting studies\"]}",

I will also provide references to supporting studies to ensure the user has a solid understanding of the benefits and effectiveness of these exercises.\n\nTextual response:\nFor managing stress and anxiety, I recommend the following exercises:\n\n1. **Yoga**: Yoga combines physical postures, breathing techniques, and meditation to reduce stress and anxiety. Studies have shown that yoga can decrease cortisol levels, improve mood, and reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression (Kumar et al., 2018; Streeter et al., 2007).\n2. **Tai Chi**: Tai Chi is a low-impact, slow-moving exercise that combines elements of martial arts and meditation. Research has found that Tai Chi can reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, improve sleep quality, and enhance overall well-being (Wang et al., 2010; Li et al., 2012).\n3. **Walking**: Walking is a low-impact aerobic exercise that can help reduce stress and anxiety by releasing endorphins, also known as \"feel-good\" hormones. Studies have shown that regular walking can reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, improve mood, and enhance overall quality of life (Harris et al., 2006; Dunn et al., 2012).\n\nThese exercises have been extensively studied and have been shown to be effective in managing stress and anxiety. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise program.\n\nReferences:\n\nDunn, A. L., et al. (2012).
