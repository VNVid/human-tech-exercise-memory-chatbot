Since you mentioned you tend to quit workouts, I'll suggest a low-commitment exercise that requires minimal equipment and can be done in a short amount of time.\n\nTextual response: I'd recommend starting with ankle circles. This exercise is easy to learn and requires no equipment. You can do it anywhere, and it's a great way to loosen up your lower legs. To perform ankle circles, sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you. Lift one foot off the ground and draw circles with your ankle, first clockwise and then counterclockwise. Repeat this process with the other foot. This exercise will help you get a feel for gentle movement and can be a great starting point for your fitness journey.\n\nImages: [1368]",

Since you've shown interest in starting with this exercise, I'll provide some additional tips to help you get the most out of it.\n\nTextual response: To get the most out of ankle circles, remember to start slowly and gently. Focus on making small, smooth circles with your ankle, rather than trying to make big movements. This will help you get a feel for the exercise and avoid any discomfort or strain. As you get more comfortable with the movement, you can gradually increase the size of the circles. Remember to breathe naturally and relax your muscles as you move your ankle. If you find that you're feeling any discomfort or pain, stop the exercise immediately and consult with a healthcare professional.\n\nImages: [1368]",

You can try doing ankle circles with your legs lifted off the ground. This will help you engage your core muscles and improve your balance. To do this, sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you. Lift one foot off the ground and draw circles with your ankle, just like before. As you get more comfortable with this variation, you can try lifting both feet off the ground and doing ankle circles while balancing on your bottom.\n\nImages: [1368, 257]",
