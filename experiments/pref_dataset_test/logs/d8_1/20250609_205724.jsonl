These can help loosen up your muscles and get you moving without feeling overwhelmed. Try the all fours squad stretch, ankle circles, or bodyweight standing calf raise. These exercises are gentle on your joints and can be done in the comfort of your own home. Remember, the goal is to start small and build up your endurance gradually.\n\nImages: [1512, 1368, 1373]",

Now, let's dive into the details of each exercise. For the all fours squad stretch, start by getting down on all fours with your hands under your shoulders and your knees under your hips. Then, bring one knee forward and place your foot flat on the ground in front of the other knee. Lean forward slightly and stretch the front of your leg. Hold for a few seconds and then switch sides. For ankle circles, sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you. Lift one foot off the ground and draw circles with your ankle, starting from small circles and getting larger. Repeat on the other side. For the bodyweight standing calf raise, stand on the edge of a step or curb with your heels hanging off the edge. Slowly raise up onto your tiptoes and then lower back down. Repeat for several sets.\n\nImages: [1512, 1368, 1373]",

This will help you maintain good form and avoid putting unnecessary strain on your back. Similarly, when doing ankle circles, try to keep your knee straight and your ankle relaxed. This will help you get the most out of the stretch and avoid any discomfort.\n\nImages: [1512, 1368, 1373]",
