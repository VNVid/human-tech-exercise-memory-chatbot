These exercises are perfect for a quick mood boost and can be done anywhere, without any equipment. Let's start with some simple bodyweight exercises like the \"Skater Hops\" or the \"Jack Burpee\". These exercises are great for getting your heart rate up and releasing endorphins, which can help improve your mood.
