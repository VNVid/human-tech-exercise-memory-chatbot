relieve back pain, I'll recommend exercises that target the muscles in the back, improve posture, and reduce strain on the spine. Given the user's preferences, I'll suggest exercises that are low-impact and gentle on the joints.\n\nTextual response: For relieving back pain, I recommend exercises like the back extension on an exercise ball, which targets the muscles in the lower back and improves posture. Another option is the inverted row, which strengthens the upper back muscles and helps improve posture. Additionally, the exercise ball hug can help stretch the muscles in the lower back and improve flexibility.\n\nImages: [1314, 499]",

I do not get the meaning of some terms\". \n    This message implies that the user wants explanations to be clear and concise, with technical terms explained in detail. \n    The user's previous message \"I do not really understand how to do it. What does extension and lift mean?\" also supports this interpretation. \n    Additionally, the user's message \"Can you make it shorter? mb just one most efficient exercise with brief explanation how to do it\" suggests that the user prefers shorter explanations. \n    Therefore, I can conclude that the user prefers clear, concise, and detailed explanations.\n\nOutput: \n{\n  \"new_preferences\": [\"clear explanations\", \"concise explanations\", \"detailed explanations\"]\n}",

  "raw_merge": "Reasoning:\n1. Compare 'old_preferences' and 'new_preferences' to identify any contradictions, refinements, or compatible preferences.\n\n- 'clear' in 'old_preferences' is a more general preference compared to 'clear explanations' in 'new_preferences'. Since 'clear explanations' is a more specific version, we keep 'clear explanations' and remove 'clear' from 'old_preferences'.\n\n- 'concise' in 'old_preferences' is a more general preference compared to 'concise explanations' in 'new_preferences'. Since 'concise explanations' is a more specific version, we keep 'concise explanations' and remove 'concise' from 'old_preferences'.\n\n- 'easy to understand' in 'old_preferences' does not directly relate to any preference in 'new_preferences'. Therefore, we keep 'easy to understand' from 'old_preferences'.\n\n- 'detailed explanations' in 'new_preferences' contradicts 'easy to understand' in 'old_preferences' because they refer to the same concept but express opposite values. We keep 'detailed explanations' and remove 'easy to understand' from 'old_preferences'.\n\n2. After removing the conflicting and less specific preferences, the resulting lists are 'old_preferences' and 'new_preferences'.\n\n3.
