These exercises are great for getting your heart rate up and releasing endorphins, which can help improve your mood. Jumping jacks are a simple and easy-to-do exercise that can be done in just a few minutes. Burpees, on the other hand, are a full-body exercise that can be modified to suit your fitness level.\n\nImages: [1160]",
