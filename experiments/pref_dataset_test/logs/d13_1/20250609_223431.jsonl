Your core muscles help you balance and feel steady. And the best part is, you can do exercises to make them stronger and help you balance even better! Some exercises that can help with balance are like squats, lunges, and single-leg stands. These exercises help your core muscles work together to keep you steady and balanced.\n\nThink:\nI'll suggest exercises that target the core muscles and improve balance.\n\nTextual response:\nFor example, you can try squats, where you stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and lower your body down, keeping your back straight and your core muscles engaged. Or, you can try single-leg stands, where you stand on one leg and balance for a few seconds. These exercises will help your core muscles get stronger and help you balance even better!\n\nImages:\n[514, 3523, 1472]",
