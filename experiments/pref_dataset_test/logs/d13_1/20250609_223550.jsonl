I will consider the user's preferences for non-technical explanations and explaining like a child.\n\nTextual response:\nLet's talk about making your core stronger! Your core is like a strong foundation that helps you stand up straight and move around easily. We can do some fun exercises to make it stronger. Here are a few ideas:\n\n*   We can do some twists to make your obliques stronger. These are the muscles on the sides of your tummy.\n*   We can also do some planks to make your abs stronger. These are the muscles in the middle of your tummy.\n*   And we can do some side bends to make your lower back muscles stronger.\n\nThese exercises will help you feel more balanced and stable. Plus, they're great for your posture!\n\nImages:\n[464, 276, 138]",

The remaining preferences in old_preferences are \"normal list\" is not present in old_preferences, but \"normal list\" is present in new_preferences, so \"normal list\" is kept.\n7.
