I'll provide a concise, scientific explanation that highlights the benefits of each type.\n\nTextual response:\nDynamic workouts involve movement and progressive resistance, such as weightlifting or bodyweight exercises that challenge the muscles through a range of motion. This type of exercise is useful for improving muscle strength, power, and endurance. On the other hand, static workouts involve holding a position for an extended period, often used for stretching or isometric exercises. While static workouts can improve muscle tone and flexibility, they may not be as effective for building strength or power. However, combining both dynamic and static workouts can provide a well-rounded fitness routine.\n\nImages:\n[]",

I'll provide a reference to a scientific study that supports the explanation.\n\nTextual response:\nMy previous explanation is based on common knowledge, but let me provide a more evidence-based answer. Research has shown that dynamic resistance training is more effective for building muscle strength and power (American College of Sports Medicine, 2018). For example, a study published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found that dynamic resistance training resulted in greater improvements in muscle strength and power compared to static resistance training (Kraemer et al., 2007). However, static stretching can be beneficial for improving flexibility and range of motion (American College of Sports Medicine, 2018).\n\nImages:\n[]\n\n### Start of system information ###\nHere is the set of exercises to choose from:\n    1.
