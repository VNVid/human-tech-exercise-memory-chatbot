I'll provide a concise explanation of the two types of exercises and highlight their benefits.\n\nTextual response:\nDynamic workouts involve movements that engage multiple joints and muscles simultaneously, such as running, jumping, or cycling. These exercises improve cardiovascular fitness, increase muscle strength and endurance, and enhance coordination and agility. On the other hand, static workouts, like yoga or isometric exercises, involve sustained contractions of specific muscle groups without movement. These exercises improve muscle tone, flexibility, and balance, while also reducing muscle soreness.\n\n### Start of system information ###\nHere is the set of exercises to choose from:\n    1.

Research has consistently shown that dynamic workouts improve cardiovascular fitness, increase muscle strength and endurance, and enhance coordination and agility (1). Static workouts, on the other hand, have been shown to improve muscle tone, flexibility, and balance, while also reducing muscle soreness (2). These findings are supported by numerous studies in the fields of exercise science and sports medicine.\n\nReferences:\n(1) American College of Sports Medicine. (2018).
